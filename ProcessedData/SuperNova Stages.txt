Supernova Five Stages in the Death of a Star Just before explosionA red supergiant starapproaches the end of itslife. There is no more fuelto burn and make it shine.Soon its massive densecore is bound to collapseunder its own weight.2. The first light flashThe core collapses andsends a shock wave out.For a few hours the shockcompresses and heats theenvelope, thus producinga very bright flash of lightfrom the inside of the star.3. The flash has goneAfter hitting the surface at50 million kmh the shockblows the star apart. Thecore turns into a neutronstar, a compact atomicnucleus with the mass ofthe Sun but 10 km in size.4. The proper SupernovaThe hot glowing surfaceexpands quickly makingthe fireball brighter again.In a few days it will be 10xthe size of the original starand will be discovered bysupernova hunters.5. A long time afterThe remains of the formerstar are spread over lightyears of space. They keepfloating quickly, sweepingup interstellar gas hereand there, leaving a faintbeautiful glow behind… Schawinksi, Justham, Wolf, et al. “Supernova shock breakout from a red supergiant”, published in Science 2008Host galaxyFlashSupernova.
